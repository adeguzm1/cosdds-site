Icons are simple symbols that attract attention, aid navigation, signal an action, add emphasis, or provide feedback. Icons serve as recognizable cues that users can understand easily — typically without thinking too hard.

Icons must be used consistently across a site or service in order to accomplish their purpose well. For example, using an envelope icon for both email and a mailing address would likely confuse people. Viewers should be able to trust that a certain icon always means the same thing, no matter where it’s used.
